# Gatsby starter for AWS Amplify Authenticator Sample

Sample includes a Tailwindcss themed authentication page that we'll use as a base to add our AWS Amplify Authenticator.

To get started, deploy this sample by clicking on the deploy button below. Amplify will fork the repository into your account and ask you to confirm deployment. Once that process is complete, clone the repository locally and continue with the tutorial.

To start the server on port 8000, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn develop
```
